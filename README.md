# Awesome-Smart-Contracts

A personal challenge on simple smart contracts built using solidity programming language.

ðŸŽ¯ My aim to get better with Solidity, Ethereum development tools and how decentralized applications validate transactions without trusted authorities/third parties.

## Project Description

These Smart contracts are built using [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org) on Ethereum Virtual Machine.

## Getting Started

Run each smart contract in a different workspace/directory on [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
